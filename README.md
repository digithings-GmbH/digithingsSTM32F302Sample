This project is a sample to show how to develop embedded Software with a ARM Cortex microcontroller.
In some embedded microcontroller projects the software in SDKc, IDEs or operating systems is very big. 3 Million or more lines of code is the rule.
Mostly you can write software with the same functionality in less than millions of code.

This example show you the using of RCC with PLL, ADC with DMA, Usart, Timer PWM for digital LED with DMA and SPI for the NFC chip ST25R3916.
With only 2400 line of code in C-Files.

This is a little cutout of a wallbox project for charging cars.

I will show you that you can develop microcontroller with very small software, where every team member know every line of code.
This is a good way for many embedded projects.

Look in the DOC folder with the guide to install the develoment environment.

A very good benefit is the opportunity tho simulate the software in a digital twin. You can start the VisualStudio solution with the StartSimulation.bat (after you have installed VisualStudio).
